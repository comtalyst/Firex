# Firex

Firex is a firefighting robot created for Trinity College International Firefighting Robot Contest 2019 (https://trinityrobotcontest.org/) by 4 students from George School, PA under guidances of robotics teacher Chris Odom: Robin, Sam, Andrew and Ian.

The competition consists of 3 levels with different rules, which could be studied from the competition's website.
This repository contains all 3 Arduino projects used as the robot's softwares, each labeled with the level that project has been implemented on the robot. However, the codes are currently disorganized, and current version of the project was discontinued after the competition. So, description and written algorithms of the project will be posted here. Stay tuned!
